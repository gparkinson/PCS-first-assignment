		<h2>Concerns about learning HTML</h2>
		<p>I'm familiar with markup languages like Tek and LaTek (not recently, but I used them a lot in school.)  I think I have a good grasp of how CSS relates to HTML elements.</p>
		<p>I haven't working in JavaScript at all but I've been proficient in a number of different programming languages over the years, so I don't think it will be too difficult.</p>
